### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Schwenger and I am currently training to become an IT specialist specializing in application development. 
I am in the third year of my apprenticeship and am expected to graduate in September 2024. 
Even as a small child, I was fascinated by the world of software. 
With my mind and drive for the latest technologies, especially in the Android and Java area, I develop software with heart and soul.
I am open to new challenges and meet them with enthusiasm. 

Happy Coding! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
